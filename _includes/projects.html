			I study the astrophysics of stars and galaxies, and have a particular interest in near-field cosmology.  I primarily work with space and large ground-based telescopes such as the <a href=http://hubblesite.org>Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <a href=http://www.keckobservatory.org>Keck</a> to measure the colors, lumionsities, and spectra of resolved stars in nearby galaxies.  These observations <a href=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/26/video/a/>encode</a> the history of star formation and chemical evolution of a galaxy, which can be measured by comparing these observations to models of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution">stellar evolution</a>. I use the "stellar fossil record" to explore a diverse set of questions such as the role of the <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4772>faintest galaxies in reionizing the early Universe</a> to measuring the <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06621>high-mass stellar initial mass function</a>.  Although I am an observer, I closely collaborate with theorists to better understand the link between baryonic (what we can see) properites of galaxies and their <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0022>dark matter properites</a>.  Some of my research includes:

			<i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group">The Local Group</a></strong>  - Our cosmic neighborhood is called The Local Group.  It consists of nearly 100 galaxies whose diversity and close proximity anchors our understanding of dark matter, stellar and galaxy evolution, and the distant Universe. I use a variety of new and archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck to study the ~100 galaxies that make up the Local Group. My work focuses on placing the Local Group into a cosmological context and includes <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7144">measuring star formation and chemical enrichemnt histories</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3281">quantifying the impact of reionization on low-mass galaxies</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06621">comparing Local Group and high-redshift galaxies</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0838">elucidaing connections between dark and luminous matter</a>, and understanding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05195">the evolution of the smallest galaxies in the Universe</a>.

			<i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/">The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)</a></strong> - PHAT is one of the largest programs in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope.  Our team used HST to resolve 1/3 of our nearest neighbor, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy>Andromeda (M31)</a>, into indivudal stars.  The survey measured colors and lumionsites of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0899">~120 million stars</a> from the ultra-violet through the near-infrared and produced a <a herf=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/02/image/a/>stunning image of M31's disk</a>. The data from PHAT has been used to study the formation of a Milky Way like system in unprecedented detail.  It has provided notable new insght into the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03338">link between star formation and galaxy evolution</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06988">dust and the ISM</a>, and the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06621">high-mass stellar IMF</a>. These studies represnt only a small fraction of the ongoing PHAT related research.

			<i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/angst/">The ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST)</a></strong> - ANGST is systematic survey of ~70 nearby galaxies (but located outside the Local Group) using the Hubble Space Telescope in order to resolve their stellar contents.  The survey produced a number of key new science insights ranging from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1093">recent star formation history of the Local Volume</a> to improvements in <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4618>stellar evolution models</a> to quantifying the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2420">relationship between star formation and the interstellar medium</a> through the <a href=https://science.nrao.edu/science/surveys/vla-angst>VLA-ANGST program</a>.  My work with ANGST has also shed light on how we <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7243">interpret the light from distant, unresolved galaxies</a>.

			<i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function">The Stellar Initial Mass Function</a></strong>
			- The stellar initial mass function for stars more massive than the Sun is central to a wide variety of astrophysics including star formation, chemical enrichment, core-collapse supernovae rates, and how we interpet the light of star-forming galaxies across the Universe.  However, the high-mass stellar IMF has proven incredibly challenging to measure.  I am focused on making <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/18/full/">concrete measurements of the high-mass stellar IMF</a> across a wide range of environments to address questions such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2965">'is the IMF universal or does it vary with respect to environment?'</a>, which greatly affects how we understand the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies across the Universe.  I am study how other effects, such as dust and "bursty" star formation can <a href="http://arxiv.org.o/abs/1109.2905">mimick IMF variations</a>.

			- I am part of the WINGS science investigation team, which has been tasked with designing a strategy to survey nearby galaxies with <a href=http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov>WFIRST</a>, a wide-field, infrared telescope being launched in 2025.  The program design phase will take place from 2016-2021.  The nearby galaxies program will focus on a diverse range of science including star formation histories, luminous and dark sub-structures in galaxy halos, and the stellar initial mass function.
