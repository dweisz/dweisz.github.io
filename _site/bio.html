			Starting in July 2016, I will be a faculty member in the <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu">Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley</a>. Currently, I am a <a href=http://www.stsci.edu/institute/smo/fellowships/hubble>Hubble Fellow</a> at the <a href=http://depts.washington.edu/astron/>University of Washington</a>.  I spent the first year of my Hubble Fellowship (2013-2014) at <a href=http://www.astro.ucsc.edu>UC Santa Cruz</a> working with <a href=http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home>Charlie Conroy</a> before moving back to Washington for the remaining two years of my fellowship (2014-2016).  Prior to being awarded a Hubble Fellowship, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washingtion working with <a href=www.astro.washington.edu/users/jd/>Julianne Dalcanton</a> on the <a href=http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html>Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury</a> (PHAT) program, one of the largest <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</a> programs in history.  Read more about my research <a href=projects.html>here</a>.

		<h4>
			In 2010, I received a PhD in Astrophysics from the <a href=http://www.astro.umn.edu>University of Minnesota</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href=http://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~skillman/>Evan Skillman</a>.  My thesis work used HST to trace  patterns of star formation in dozens of nearby dwarf galaxies back in time to their formation in the early Universe. Prior to my PhD, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I received a double degree in Physics and Astrophysics in 2004.

		<h4>
			I am the proud product of public schools from elementary school through my PhD.  In 2000, I graduated from <a href=http://southwest.mpls.k12.mn.us>Minneapolis Southwest High School</a> an <a href=http://www.ibo.org>International Baccalaureate Diploma</a>.  For middle school, I attended the pre-IB program at <a href=http://anwatin.mpls.k12.mn.us>Anwatin Middle School</a>. I was fortunate to have attended an outstanding and very unusual elementary school: <a href=http://dowling.mpls.k12.mn.us>Dowling Urban Environmental Learning Center</a>.

		<h4>
			Outside of Astronomy, I have spent most of my life around soccer fields. Starting at age 3, I played for various park and club teams around the Twin Cities. In college, I played for the <a href=http://recsports.berkeley.edu/sports/sport-clubs/mens-teams/soccer-m/>UC Berkeley Men's Club Team</a>, and later for the <a href=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/university-of-minnesota-men-s-club-soccer/home> University of Minnesota Men's Club Team</a>, reaching the <a href=http://nirsa.net/nirsa/soccer/>NIRSA national club tournament</a> with both schools. I also played for several high-level amateur teams, including Blackhawks of the <a href=http://www.masl.org>Minnesota Amateur Soccer League</a> and Minnesota NSC United of the semi-professional <a href=http://www.nationalpremiersoccerleague.com>National Premier Soccer League</a>.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			I am also a high-level soccer coach who has worked with very competitive girls' and womens' teams. I coached club soccer with the <a href=http://www.mnthunderacademy.org>Minnesota Thunder Academy</a> (formerly Bangu FC), where I prepared youth players for the transition to the collegiate level. Most players I coached went on to play collegiate soccer, and several players were selected to represent the U.S. at various youth international levels. I also spent a couple of seasons working with the U.S. Youth Soccer <a href=http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/programs/olympicdevelopmentprogram/>Olympic Develpment Program</a>, and I hold <a href=http://www.ussoccer.com/coaching-education/licenses/national-d>National 'D'</a> coaching license from the <a href=http://www.ussoccer.com>United States Soccer Federation</a>.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			In addition to club coaching, I was also an assistant coach at the high school and collegiate levels with womens' teams at the <a href=http://www.academyofholyangels.org/>Academy of Holy Angels High School</a>, the <a href=http://www.tommiesports.com/sports/wsoc/index>University of St. Thomas</a>, and <a href=http://www.goslugs.com/sports/wsoc/index>UC Santa Cruz</a>. Highlights from these programs include the success of the St. Thomas teams, which made multiple NCAA national tournament appearances, won a <a href=http://www.miacathletics.com>Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> championship, and completed an <a href=http://www.tommiesports.com/sports/wsoc/2008-09/releases/11-01-2008-womens-soccer-wins-31-are-miac-champs-alone.html>undefeated regular season in 2008</a>.
